        <![CDATA[<p>iOS 9 came out yesterday, and Apple snuck in a functionality called &quot;content blockers&quot; for Safari. Developers can make content blockers do all sorts of things, but mostly what they do is block ads. As of today, three of the top four paid apps on the app store are content blockers.</p>
<p>For obvious reasons, many of my former colleagues in the online, ad-supported content-creation industry, have been wringing their hands over this.</p>
<p>Nilay Patel, EIC of <em>The Verge</em> wrote a <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/9/17/9338963/welcome-to-hell-apple-vs-google-vs-facebook-and-the-slow-death-of-the-web">blood-soaked piece</a> about how this is all a proxy war between Google, Apple, and Facebook. Apple wants to kill Google, Google needs the web to make money, so Apple kills the web with content blockers and pushes people toward native app experiences it controls. Facebook picks up any stragglers in this scenario.</p>
<p>From a user perspective, ads on the web are garbage. Tracking scripts are almost as bad. Most web content is delivered with a heaping pile of both. Megabytes, and multiple latency-inducing roundtrips, are the price of viewing most popular web content today on sites like <em>The Verge</em>, <em>Buzzfeed</em>, etc.</p>
<p>Ad-blockers are an easy, painless solution to this problem from a user perspective. From a publisher perspective, they're a nightmare.</p>
<p>In a world of ad-blockers, online publishers become the music industry when it ran into Napster. Or the TV industry when it ran into TiVo.</p>
<p>Yesterday I argued on Twitter: &quot;if you like something, and dodge that something's creator's chosen method of monetization, you're killing that something&quot;</p>
<p>Saying &quot;adapt or die,&quot; as many people who run ad-blockers say to anyone who will listen, is basically armed robbery: &quot;give me your content, or give me your content and die.&quot;</p>
<p>I've been torn over ad-blockers for a long time. I know it would be hypocritical of me to run one, because ad supported websites like <em>Engadget</em> and <em>The Verge</em> have paid my bills in the past. But, also, ads are horrible and <a href="https://blog.yourkarma.com/i-hate-ads">my least favorite thing in any medium</a>.</p>
<p>But I finally figured out the Third Way: stop using all these garbage websites all the time.</p>
<p>I click <em>Buzzfeed</em> links and <em>Verge</em> links and <em>Awl</em> links and <em>Polygon</em> links for the same reason anybody does: there's a hole in my heart, and I hope 300-400 words of web content will fill it. If I want to learn anything of lasting importance, I read it in a book. If I want to be entertained, I watch a movie on Netflix. If I want to learn how to do something, I read it on some developer's self-hosted blog. If something is truly valuable it's usually free or paid-for. Ad-supported things are usually built not because they are necessary, but because they will generate more clicks and therefore more ad revenue.</p>
<p>Just think about it: where do you see the <em>most</em> ads? Where do you see the <em>worst</em> ads? Where do you see so many garbage ads all at once that you can barely find the &quot;content&quot;? It's those clickbait lists under the &quot;Sponsored Links&quot; section.</p>
<p>&quot;<a href="http://www.womensforum.com/trending/child-stars-grew-up-hot/">14 Child Stars Who Are Now Super Hot</a>&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;<a href="http://www.lifedaily.com/25-celebrities-that-you-forgot-committed-horrible-crimes/">24 Celebs You Forgot Committed Horrible Crimes: #19 is Shocking</a>&quot;</p>
<p>These pages are so full of garbage it's actually truly difficult to consume the &quot;content&quot; that brought me there. Oh, and that content is a gallery, so that each picture counts as a whole page view.</p>
<p>Most ad-supported websites on the internet are just a kinder, gentler, less offensive, slightly more entertaining version of these spammy clickbaiters. They're designed to make you <em>forget</em> you're being clickbaited. But they earn money from a complex mathematical formula that looks like like this: (page views) x (audience quality). If you're rich, and you click a lot, that site wins.</p>
<p>When I read a book or watch a movie or listen to an album, I usually get the sense that the creator of that thing values my time and attention as much I do. Values it as in &quot;attempts not to squander,&quot; not &quot;ooh, I can monetize this.&quot;</p>
<p>In a <a href="http://www.theawl.com/2015/02/the-next-internet-is-tv">really great piece</a> exploring this topic (subtitled: &quot;Websites are unnecessary vestiges of a time before there were better ways to find things to look at on your computer or your phone.&quot;), John Herrman explains how content creators are moving to native platforms like Facebook and Snapchat because that's where the eyeballs are. These &quot;enormous middlemen apps,&quot; says Herrman, &quot;have <strong>no special interest in publishing beyond value extraction through advertising</strong>&quot; (his emphasis).</p>
<p>And see, that's my worry, that's my problem. More than half the time when I'm at <em>Buzzfeed</em> and <em>The Verge</em> (I keep using <em>Buzzfeed</em> and <em>The Verge</em> as examples because I visit them a lot apparently), I get the distinct feeling that this publication has &quot;<strong>no special interest in publishing beyond value extraction through advertising</strong>&quot;. And if that's the case, then it's really important that I, as a human being with presumably better things to do, should avoid publications that make me feel this way.</p>
<p>I guess what I'm saying is this: I want to stop reading ad-supported websites. I don't want to steal their content by browsing with an ad-blocker, I want to <em>ignore</em> their content. I need a content blocker that blocks <em>content</em> too. Will I miss out on some stuff that's truly impressive, truly hilarious, truly insightful? Undoubtedly. But I'll also miss out on a lot of garbage, and a ton of garbage ads. So that will be nice.</p>
<p>Will I do any of this? No, probably not. Sites like <em>Buzzfeed</em> and <em>The Verge</em> are too enticing. I am weak. Which means I probably shouldn't run an ad-blocker, because then I'm just being a hypocritical jerk in addition to being weak.</p>
<p>But man, wouldn't it be nice to live in a world where I never have to read something that was written for the sole purpose of traffic and revenue? Where I only read things that need to exist, or are worth money on their own merits? Imagine this: words, on the internet, worth paying for.</p>
<p>The web doesn't have to be terrible. And, in fact, there are a lot of great parts of it. But online publications seem to have coalesced around the worst elements: huge ads, disposable content, auto-play videos, Like and Tweet buttons which follow you around the internet, hidden embedded pixels that try and guess your eye color so they can sell you shampoo more effectively. It's sites like these that make me regret how permissive HTML is.</p>
<p>The reason there's no solid revenue alternative to advertising for most of these websites is that most of what they put out is junkfood clickbait designed to increase revenue through ads. They can't monetize it because it's worthless. Is that ironic? It could be ironic.</p>
<p>P.S. I've recently signed up for <a href="https://www.google.com/contributor/welcome/">Google Contributor</a>, which is akin to something I asked for a while ago: to &quot;bid on my own eyeballs.&quot; There are two main issues with Google Contributor:</p>
<ol>
<li>It doesn't seem to actually do anything, I still see tons of garbage ads everywhere, served to me by Google. Apparently Mashable accepts Contributor, but I hate Mashable, it's a terrible repository of clickbait for people who live in San Francisco.</li>
<li>It rewards pageviews, which was really the whole point of this rant. Advertising is value extraction through pageviews, and so is Google Contributor. It's clearly the wrong kind of incentive. See: Mashable.</li>

        E-sports for the uninformed

        <![CDATA[<p><em>I wrote this post almost a full year ago (the text file is timestamped May 27th, 2014). Pro play just started up again, and everything in here is still relevant. I realize now that this article probably has the wrong balance of jargon and dumbed-down-ness. Like, if you understand half of the RPG slang I have in here, you probably know more about League of Legends than I do. Still, I had to try.</em></p>
<p>Last year, 32 million people watched the <em>League of Legends</em> Season 3 World Championship. Every weekend, millions tune into &quot;regular season&quot; matches between their favorite teams. Any given moment, tens of thousands of &quot;LoL&quot; diehards are watching their favorite streamer on Twitch.tv slay scrubs on &quot;solo queue.&quot; The NFL doesn't start back up until September. You do the math. I'm going to teach you how to extract Real Sports Moments from this inscrutable &quot;esport,&quot; based on my own ill-founded knowledge of the subject, until you have something better to do.</p>
<p>Step 1: pick a stream</p>
<p>It's not hard to find a <em>League of Legends</em> livestream. Simply visit Twitch.tv and click on that first big link on the left that says &quot;League of Legends.&quot; Outside of the occasional <em>Dota 2</em> tournament (<em>Dota 2</em> is very similar to <em>League of Legends</em>, and most of the following tips can be applied), <em>League of Legends</em> holds the perennial top spot on Twitch for most concurrent viewers. Typically in the mere ~80k range, viewership spikes to 200k+ whenever a professional match is happening. There are actually five major leagues worldwide, in addition to an amateur league (the Challenger Series) which happens in parallel. While the highest level of play is currently in South Korea, China, and Europe, I prefer the North American league because the stream is in HD and the hours are predictable and EST-friendly.</p>
<p>If there aren't any pro matches happening when you try to tune in, you can find an archive of broadcasts on the <a href="http://www.twitch.tv/riotgames/profile/pastBroadcasts">Riot Games Twitch page</a>, or browse through a prettier (but spoiler-filled) collection of matches at the <a href="http://na.lolesports.com/">official site</a>.</p>
<p>Step 2: back a team</p>
<p>This is the least important step of the process, and I encourage you to switch loyalties on a whim. You know how that one friend of yours doesn't know anything about football, and every Super Bowl he roots for the team with the &quot;best uniform&quot;? And you know how you loathe him, but secretly envy his ability to derive enjoyment from watching a contest with none of the potential heartache of a &quot;true&quot; fan? This is your chance to <em>be that guy</em>!</p>
<p>Basically, one team starts on the bottom left and has blue health bars, and the other team starts on the top right and has red health bars. I typically root for blue as a default, because blue = good, red = bad in typical video game scenarios. Still, it's important to hold this choice loosely. Unlike many professional sports, <em>League of Legends</em> matches have what's called a &quot;snowball effect,&quot; where by default the strong get stronger and the weak get weaker. This means that if a team gets out to an early lead, they'll most likely win the match, and so it's a safe bet to root for the team with an edge by the 5-10 minute mark if you're looking for minimal disappointment.</p>
<p>Of course, after a year or so of watching professional <em>League</em>, I've got some favorites. TSM, for instance, has a number of qualities I look for in a professional esports team. On average, TSM players are better looking, and better dressed, than the competition. They wear matching varsity jackets and grey skinny jeans, in a sport dominated by schlubby hoodies and logo-emblazoned motocross apparel. TSM also has Bjergsen, voted MVP of the 2014 LCS Spring Split, and my vote for &quot;who wore it best&quot; IRT the varsity jacket / skinny jean combo.</p>
<p>Step 3: count the creeps</p>
<p>I suppose this is the point in the guide where I should give you a basic idea of the &quot;point&quot; of a <em>League of Legends</em> match. But, really, it's not the most important thing. Watching <em>LoL</em> matches for the results is like watching soccer for &quot;all the goals they score all the time,&quot; except in <em>LoL</em> there's only one goal scored (destroying the opponent &quot;Nexus,&quot; at the back of their color-coded base), and the team that scores the goal wins instantly. Everything else is posturing, positioning, and grinding.</p>
<p>Basically, <em>League of Legends</em> gameplay is an accelerated version of an RPG level grind. Each player gains gold and experience by killing monsters (and each other), spends the gold on better gear, and levels up their powers with the experience. The most basic unit in the game is a &quot;minion,&quot; which stream endlessly from each base along mirrored &quot;lanes.&quot; The number of minions and other creatures killed by a player is called their &quot;creep score,&quot; and it's a good shorthand for how much relative gold and experience -- and therefore power -- they've accumulated. The creep score (typically referred to as &quot;CS&quot;) is listed next to the player's avatar icon at the bottom of the screen.</p>
<p>Different players will have wildly different CS, and that typically denotes their differing roles on the team. Typically a team will have a couple &quot;carrys&quot; (most CS), a &quot;jungler&quot; (a lot of CS), a &quot;tank&quot; (less CS), and a support (least CS). These roles aren't set in stone (there's an ever-evolving &quot;meta&quot; which dictates how teams are composed), and I'm actually not sure I got the order right anyway. What's important is that one or two players on each team will be &quot;stacked&quot; with the most gear and levels, while their teammates work hard to keep them alive and &quot;fed&quot; (more gear, more levels). And then they all fight.</p>
<p>Step 4: root for kills</p>
<p>Here's where the magic happens. Specifically, Bjergsen magic. You know that classic RPG feeling you get when you grind a few levels, buy some new gear, and suddenly those monsters which were so scary ten minutes ago seem to melt under your oversized sword blows? This is why I watch <em>League</em>. Inevitably, somebody gets &quot;fed&quot; (like, for instance, Bjergsen) and somebody gets melted. This is always satisfying.</p>
<p>There are innumerable factors that go into a successful melting, and the more you watch <em>League</em> the more you'll pick up on, but I'll walk you a few of the basics to help boost your initial satisfaction.</p>
<p>First, a player &quot;wins his lane,&quot; &quot;counter jungles,&quot; or &quot;ganks&quot; somebody. To get the snowball rolling, all he needs is an edge somewhere. This can be achieved by killing minion waves while keeping his mirror matchup from doing the same, trespassing into enemy area and stealing &quot;camps&quot; (stationary minions on set spawn timers), or simply finding vulnerable players and killing them. Once he pulls ahead, it becomes even easier to do all of the above activities -- each of which also harm opposing players.</p>
<p>Once a player builds a clear lead, the opponent must make a difficult decision: do they invest their limited resources in damage-dealing items, in hopes to catch their terrorizer off guard and defeat him, or do they build &quot;tanky&quot; and merely hope to survive? Obviously, this being a video game played by men in their early 20s, they typically pick the damage option. This results in what's known as a &quot;squishy&quot; hero.</p>
<p>To be honest, this is what used to frustrate me about <em>League of Legends</em>. Now I see it as a virtuous cycle. Exciting comebacks, a mainstay of most professional sporting leagues, are incredibly rare in <em>League</em>. Ultimately, I'm rooting for someone to dominate. A close match can be entertaining in its own way, but ultimately a win comes when one team gains a clear advantage and pummels the opponent into submission. Really, match dynamics are more like MMA or boxing than traditional team sports. You're rooting for a KO.</p>
<p>Step 5: complain about the casters</p>
<p>An age-old tradition in obsessive sports spectating is hating on the announcers. There's so much satisfaction to be found in feeling smugly superior to a sport's &quot;professional&quot; experts. This satisfaction is multiplied by the inherent silliness of a man whose job is to yell excitedly about what's happening in a fantasy-themed action RPG.</p>
<p>This is no easy task, of course. A <em>League of Legends</em> caster needs to have an encyclopedic knowledge of hundreds of avatars, players, items, and strategies. Then they need to inform the viewer of relevant facts pertaining to ten players, each juggling a subset of these avatars, items, and strategies, in real time, as the game unfolds. More astonishingly, a good caster can explain the specific spells and abilities being used by different players during a fight which, to my untrained eye, looks like a series of unrelated explosions and lens flares.</p>
<p>On top of all this complexity is the pronoun problem: a player is a &quot;he,&quot; but his avatar could be a &quot;he,&quot; &quot;she,&quot; or &quot;it.&quot; When his avatar attacks another avatar, the pronoun possibilities explode, and the poor, put-upon caster frequently retreats to the vaguest possible terms to refer to the parties involved.</p>
<p>Basically, a caster is set up to fail, and failing is <em>hilarious</em>. A caster has absolutely no chance of making the game &quot;accessible&quot; to the uninitiated. I have no idea what it means that &quot;Kha'Zix&quot; is trying to build his &quot;Blade of the Ruined King,&quot; and probably never will, because five thousand other things just happened during that sentence. Things that happen in <em>League</em> are so alien that many casters have difficulty spitting out sensical analogies to or summaries of the melee, resulting garbled phrases along the lines of &quot;boom goes the dynamite.&quot;</p>
<p>Step 6: ignore chat</p>
<p>All the difficulties in realtime match analysis I just listed? Now imagine them undertaken by 200,000 racist, sexist, illiterate 13-year-olds in an IRC chatroom. The accompanying Twitch.tv chat is my least favorite part of the current esports scene, and most of the time I just pretend it doesn't exist. I'm sure there are other calm, mature fans of <em>DotA</em>, <em>League</em>, and <em>StarCraft</em>, but they're difficult to find in the Twitch chat spamfest. You've been warned.</p>
<p>Step 7: root for the humans</p>
<p>Ultimately, I find nearly all esports fascinating and compelling because of one shared element: human players. The qualities specific to professional video games include fast reflexes (like that of a NASCAR driver), manual dexterity (akin to a piano player), an extensive memory (sort of like chess), and the endurance to stay sharp throughout a match which can last anywhere from 20 minutes to an hour.</p>
<p>The high production values of the NA LCS makes these and other human factors apparent. You can see the nerves of young players, practically shaking before a match begins. The fatigue and pain, as they massage their aching hands with heat packs. Bravado as they strut on stage to a cheering crowd. Disappointment, as they slump in their chairs and stare blankly at their LCDs in defeat. Social awkwardness, as they fist bump, hug, and shake hands</p>
<p><em>... LOL THAT'S WHERE I LEFT OFF. Way to be a finisher, Paul. Way to see it through to the end like a real pro. I guess, as a wrap up, I'd say... hmm, not really sure what to say. Guess that's why this is a cliffhanger! So draw your own conclusions, I'm done.</em></p>

        Call me when you're Turing complete
      </title>
      <link>https://pauljmiller.com/call-me-when-youre-turing-complete.html</link>

        <![CDATA[<p><em>Editor's note: I wrote this at E3 in 2012. I don't think it makes a strong or clear enough point, and I'm guessing that's why I or my editor killed it. What I love about it though is how games like Shadow of Mordor and No Man's Sky are showing the power of simulation and procedural generation in making compelling AAA games. I can't say &quot;see I told you so&quot; because I never did, but still: see?</em></p>
<p>When I think about &quot;next-gen&quot; games, my mind typically rushes to graphics. Square Enix's <em>Final Fantasy</em> tech demo at E3 is the current winner in this regard, with Ubisoft's <em>Watch_Dogs</em> and Epic's Unreal Engine 4 running close behind. And it's true, the next generation of consoles are going to have graphics that will make current standouts like <em>Uncharted</em> and <em>Gears of War</em> look quaint. I'm excited about this; I love looking at things, especially pretty things. But ultimately graphics are iterative, just like most of the game mechanics that have arrived in this console generation. What sort of game mechanics will help the next generation of games take a left turn and offer experiences that are entirely new?</p>
<p>When I think <em>really hard</em> about &quot;next-gen&quot; games, I think about <em>Dwarf Fortress</em>. In the game you build a simulated society, brick by brick. It's like <em>The Sims</em> meets <em>Minecraft</em>. Your dwarves live entire simulated lives under your care, mining, crafting, building, farming, sleeping, eating, and fighting. They care about each other, they care about beer, they care what quality of materials the furniture in their room is made out of. Dwarves frequently go insane, or starve themselves to death in grief, or carve their stories into the walls of your fortress.</p>
<p><em>Dwarf Fortress</em> is in ASCII. It's ugly. It's impossibly difficult to play. It's simulating so much that it can struggle with &quot;frame rate&quot; as your fortress grows in complexity. I typically play it for a couple days, sinking hours into referencing tutorials and building porous fortresses that typically fall to the first wave of hostile elves — or elephants. Then I give up, Google to see if there are any <em>Minecraft</em> mods yet that offer a decent subset of <em>Dwarf Fortress</em>, and then it's 4am and I have to work the next day.</p>
<p>Something I love about <em>Minecraft</em> and <em>Dwarf Fortress</em> is that they're what's called &quot;Turing Complete,&quot; meaning that they're capable of sufficiently complex simulations to allow you to build a computer within the game — or at least a calculator. All this really requires is switches, and a way to chain those switches together in a way that they can be manipulated by inputs and by each other. In <em>Dwarf Fortress</em> you can use flowing water and wooden gates to get your Turing on, in <em>Minecraft</em> there's redstone wiring and switches — Notch was heavily influenced by <em>Dwarf Fortress</em>, and made a point of making his game Turing Complete, a &quot;feature&quot; that was a bit more incedental in <em>Dwarf Fortress</em>.</p>
<p>Of course, I've never built a computer in either game, and have no plans to. But I think the fact that I <em>can</em> makes a statement about what sort of game it is. I feel like the virtual world of Neal Stephenson's <em>Snow Crash</em> would have no problem with Turing, and in William Gibson's <em>Neuromancer</em>, the entire virtual world is basically made out of representations of computers. But imagine building a computer with your friends in <em>World of Warcraft</em>, or in <em>Grand Theft Auto</em>'s &quot;open world&quot;.</p>
<p>In <em>Mass Effect</em>, you have a few hundred choices to make through the game, and a handful of potential outcomes at the end — which puts it in the top echelon for choice in console games. In <em>Dwarf Fortress</em>, the story writes itself, it's infinitely varied, and there is no end. I'm not about abandoning story, like in <em>Sim City</em> or <em>Civilization</em>, I just want the story to be the game itself, and granularly impacted by my every action — I don't want glorified checkpoints with &quot;sandbox&quot; in between.</p>
<p>I don't think these ideas are new, but they're commonly associated with indie and fringe games, not the elusive next-gen consoles from Microsoft and Sony that could be in our homes sometime late next year. What simulation needs is a serious game studio and some serious hardware to pull it from the ghetto.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>This was long overdue. There are things I think about, and now I can publish all of them on the internet. Not just, you know, the sort of thing that belongs on Engadget, The Verge, or the Karma blog. But stuff that belongs under a sort of banner like &quot;Paul's blog&quot; so you really know what to expect.</p>
<p>I think I'll start out by putting up some of the not-published writing I've done. There are lots of reasons that things I've written don't get published, but there's usually one super-reason: they weren't good enough to publish. But this is a blog, so I'm lowering my standards.</p>
<p>I hope that you enjoy the things I put up here, and, as a long overdue / badly placed sidenote: <em>thank you for reading</em>. I've been really blessed in my life to find an audience for my words and thoughts, and I don't take it for granted. You're the real MVP.</p>
